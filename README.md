# Project Description:

The inspiration for this project stems from the developer's personal experiences with the Camino, noting the outdated nature of existing websites. The objective is to leverage modern web development practices to offer a full-stack website that enhances the pilgrimage experience for both solo and group travelers. The project targets a niche market, focusing on attracting a younger audience and providing support to solo travelers through a user-friendly platform that facilitates route planning, social interaction, and access to critical information without paywalls.

Feasibility studies cover market potential, commercial viability, unique selling points (USPs), technical feasibility, and risk assessment. The project's USPs include a modern design, newcomer-friendly interface, and real-time updates on accommodation availability. Technical implementation relies on Angular for the front end, MongoDB for data storage, and AWS for hosting and authentication, ensuring scalability and security.

The UX design emphasizes simplicity and modernity, with features like sign-in screens, navigation bars, carousels, and informative pages. The development schedule outlines a phased approach, starting with front-end development, followed by back-end integration, aiming for a complete product by early May, followed by debugging and final report preparation.

In summary, Pilgrim's Portal aims to modernize the pilgrimage planning and execution process, making it more accessible and engaging for a diverse audience. Through the application of agile methodologies and cutting-edge technologies, the project seeks to deliver a comprehensive platform that addresses the unique needs of pilgrims in the digital age.
